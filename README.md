Graceful degradation in web development refers to the strategy of building your web functionality so that it provides a high level of user experience in modern browsers, yet it will still function in older browsers. If a feature is not supported in a user's browser, the website will still be accessible, albeit with a simplified experience. On the other hand, service workers are a type of web worker. They're JavaScript files that can control the web page/site it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources. In the context of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), service workers enable a web app to load instantly, regardless of the network state, providing a consistent user experience. They allow developers to control the cache and leverage offline capabilities, which is a key component in creating reliable PWAs. Together, graceful degradation and service workers help create robust, user-friendly web experiences.
